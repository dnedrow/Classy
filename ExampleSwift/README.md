# Swift Example Application

This is a simple application demonstrating how Classy integrates with Swift projects.

The project Podfile is set to use the Classy library in the folder above this example, i.e. **'..'**.

For this reason, you may want to run ```pod update``` to ensure the example project is using the current code.

As of the time this document was written, the library version is 0.2.6.

The project requires Xcode 9 to compile.
